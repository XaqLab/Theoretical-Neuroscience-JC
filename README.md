### Theoretical Neuroscience Journal Club

We are a cross-departmental student run group, whose aim is to bring together the Houston computational neuroscience community (BCM/RICE/UH). We meet approximately weekly to discuss a paper or collection of papers. The presentations are organized in topics, where each topic spans alternating weeks. Every other week will be focused on our [NeuroNex center project](https://www.bcm.edu/news/grants/nsf-grant-understand-the-brain), which seeks to infer graphical models for interactions between neurons and the world. The other weeks we will have more flexibility in topics, including cellular, systems, cognitive, etc.

#### Meeting Time & Place
